# Project Context — Changelog SaaS

Every task, feature, and design decision should be understood through the lens of this document. Read and internalize this context before starting any work.

## What We Are Building

A changelog service for other SaaS businesses. The product includes an embeddable widget that sits in a client's website and shows their end-users that the product is actively improving and is not abandonware.

We are building a minimalistic, clean, and professional tool where users can:

- Edit their changelogs in a Notion-like fashion (block-based rich editing)
- Store images alongside changelog entries
- Edit changelogs and deploy them — all from one place

## Competitors

- Beamer
- Announcekit
- Frill
- LaunchNotes
- FeatureBase

Some of these competitors also handle things beyond changelogs (feedback boards, roadmaps, etc.), but our focus right now is changelogs only. We may expand scope later.

## Product Goal

The goal is to deliver great UI/UX and actually solve a real user pain. This means:

- The interface must feel polished, fast, and intuitive — not bloated or over-engineered.
- Every feature should earn its place. If it doesn't help the user publish or manage changelogs more effectively, question whether it belongs.
- We are competing on simplicity and quality of experience, not on feature count.

## How to Use This Context

When working on any task, ask yourself:

1. Does this serve the core use case — helping SaaS teams publish and manage changelogs?
2. Does the UI/UX feel clean, minimal, and professional?
3. Would this hold up next to Beamer or Announcekit in terms of polish?
4. Is this the simplest solution that solves the problem well?
