PHASE 1 — TABLE STAKES (what every competitor ships out of the box)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

0. remove the ability to upload videos. only embed.

1. SCHEDULED PUBLISHING
   Beamer, Headway, and FeatureBase all let you pick a future date/time and the
   post goes live automatically. Add a date+time picker to the editor toolbar
   and a server-side cron or delayed mutation that flips status at publish time.

2. UNPUBLISH / REVERT TO DRAFT
   Canny and FeatureBase let you pull a published post back to draft instantly.
   Add an "Unpublish" button on the edit page for published entries that sets
   status back to "draft" and hides it from the widget and public page.

3. REACTIONS / EMOJI FEEDBACK
   Beamer shows emoji reactions (👍 🎉 ❤️) under each post; AnnounceKit and
   FeatureBase do the same. Add a reaction bar to the widget feed items and
   public page entries, store counts per changelog, surface totals in dashboard.

4. BASIC ANALYTICS (VIEW COUNTS + ENGAGEMENT)
   AnnounceKit tracks views, clicks, and top-performing posts. Beamer has a
   full analytics dashboard. Start simple: record a view event each time a
   changelog is seen in the widget or public page, show view + reaction counts
   on the changelog list in the dashboard.

5. AUTO-SAVE DRAFTS
   FeatureBase auto-saves as you type so nothing gets lost. Debounce editor
   changes (e.g. every 5 seconds of inactivity) and silently persist the draft
   to Convex. Show a subtle "Saved" / "Saving..." indicator near the title.

6. FEATURED IMAGES / COVER IMAGES
   Canny, FeatureBase, and Headway let you attach a hero image per changelog.
   Add an optional cover image upload above the title in the editor. Display it
   at the top of the public page entry and as a thumbnail in the widget feed.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 2 — CATEGORIES & ORGANIZATION (how competitors structure content)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

7. CATEGORIES (SEPARATE FROM LABELS)
   LaunchNotes distinguishes categories (product areas: "iOS", "API", "Billing")
   from labels (change types: "Feature", "Bugfix"). Categories drive subscriber
   preferences and widget filtering. Labels stay as visual tags. Add a new
   categories table, a management UI in settings, and a category picker in the
   editor alongside the existing label chips.

8. WIDGET CATEGORY FILTERING
   LaunchNotes lets you configure each widget embed to show only specific
   categories, so different pages of your app show relevant updates only.
   Add a data-categories attribute to the script tag that filters the feed.
   Dashboard shows a per-widget category selector in widget settings.

9. SEARCH & FILTER ON PUBLIC PAGE
   Canny and FeatureBase public pages have a search bar and category/label
   filter dropdowns. Add a sticky filter bar at the top of the public changelog
   page with a text search input and clickable category/label pills.

10. PAGINATION / INFINITE SCROLL
    Every competitor paginates their feeds. Currently you load all changelogs at
    once. Add cursor-based pagination to the widget API and public page, loading
    ~10 entries at a time with a "Load more" button or infinite scroll trigger.

11. RSS / ATOM / JSON FEED
    Headway, Canny, and AnnounceKit auto-generate RSS feeds for each project.
    Add a /api/feed/:slug route to the HTTP router that returns an RSS 2.0 XML
    document. Link it in the public page header with <link rel="alternate">.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 3 — NOTIFICATIONS & SUBSCRIBERS (the #1 gap vs. competitors)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

12. SUBSCRIBER / EMAIL LIST MANAGEMENT
    Beamer, LaunchNotes, and AnnounceKit all maintain subscriber lists. Add a
    subscribers table (email, name, preferences, source). Build a subscribers
    page in the dashboard showing the list with search, import CSV, and manual
    add. Let users subscribe from the public changelog page.

13. EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS ON PUBLISH
    Beamer and AnnounceKit send styled HTML emails when a changelog goes live.
    Integrate an email service (Resend, Postmark, or SES). When a changelog is
    published, send a branded email to all subscribers (or filtered by category
    preferences). Add an email preview step before publishing.

14. EMAIL DIGEST / WEEKLY ROUNDUP
    LaunchNotes offers digest emails that bundle multiple updates. Add a
    scheduled job that collects changelogs published in the last week and sends
    a single digest email to subscribers who opted into the digest frequency.

15. SUBSCRIBE WIDGET IN THE EMBED
    AnnounceKit and Beamer let users enter their email directly in the widget
    feed. Add an email input at the bottom of the widget feed panel with a
    "Get notified" CTA. On submit, create a subscriber record and confirm.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 4 — SEGMENTATION & TARGETING (the premium differentiator)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

16. USER IDENTITY PASSING (WIDGET)
    Beamer accepts user attributes via the script tag (data-user-id, data-email,
    data-plan, plus custom properties). Update the widget script to accept and
    forward user attributes to the API so the backend knows who is viewing.

17. SEGMENTS BUILDER
    Beamer lets you create segments with AND/OR filter rules on user attributes
    (e.g. plan = "pro" AND country = "US"). Add a segments table and a visual
    segment builder UI in the dashboard where you define filter conditions.

18. TARGETED CHANGELOG DELIVERY
    Beamer and LaunchNotes let you assign segments to each changelog post so
    only matching users see it. Add a segment picker in the changelog editor.
    The widget API filters results server-side based on the viewer's attributes
    matching the assigned segment rules.

19. COHORTS (MANUAL AUDIENCE LISTS)
    LaunchNotes has "cohorts" — hand-picked subscriber lists for targeted email
    sends. Add a cohorts management page where you create named lists, add
    subscribers by email/domain, and select cohorts as recipients when publishing.


────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 5 — INTEGRATIONS & POWER FEATURES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

20. SLACK / TEAMS / WEBHOOK NOTIFICATIONS
    Beamer and LaunchNotes push to Slack and Teams on publish. Add a webhooks
    settings page where users configure a Slack incoming webhook URL or generic
    webhook. Fire a POST with changelog details on publish.

21. AI WRITING ASSISTANT
    Beamer, AnnounceKit, and FeatureBase offer AI-powered draft generation.
    Add a "Draft with AI" button in the editor that takes a short description
    or bullet points and generates a polished changelog entry using an LLM API.

22. COMMENTS ON CHANGELOG ENTRIES
    Beamer allows threaded comments on posts. Add a comments section below each
    entry on the public page and in the widget. Store comments with author info
    and timestamps. Show comment count in the dashboard changelog list.

23. MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORT
    AnnounceKit supports localized changelogs in multiple languages. Add a
    locale field to changelogs and a language switcher on the public page and
    widget. Allow creating translated versions of the same changelog entry.

24. CUSTOM DOMAIN FOR PUBLIC PAGE
    LaunchNotes and AnnounceKit let you serve the public changelog on your own
    domain (e.g. updates.yourapp.com). Add CNAME verification in settings and
    configure routing so the public page serves under the custom domain.

25. CHANGELOG TEMPLATES
    FeatureBase and Notion offer reusable templates for common update types.
    Add a templates library in settings where users save and reuse content
    structures (e.g. "Feature Release", "Hotfix", "Monthly Roundup").

NOTES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Phases 1-2 are catch-up work. Most paying customers expect these.
- Phase 3 (email) is the single biggest revenue unlock — it's what makes
  changelog tools sticky and justifies paid tiers.
- Phase 4 (segmentation) is the premium play. Beamer charges $99+/mo for it.
  Build it last but design the data model early so you don't paint yourself
  into a corner.
- Phase 5 is polish and expansion. Prioritize based on user requests.
